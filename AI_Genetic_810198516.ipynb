    "The genetic algorithm is a random-based classical evolutionary algorithm. By random here we mean that in order to find a solution using the GA, random changes applied to the current solutions to generate new ones. GA is based on Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution. GA works on a population consisting of some solutions where the population size is the number of solutions. Each solution is called individual. Each individual solution has a chromosome. The chromosome is represented as a set of parameters (features) that defines the individual. Each chromosome has a set of genes. Each individual has a fitness value. To select the best individuals, a fitness function is used. The result of the fitness function is the fitness value representing the quality of the solution. The higher the fitness value the higher the quality the solution. Selection of the best individuals based on their quality is applied to generate what is called a mating pool where the higher quality individual has higher probability of being selected in the mating pool. All these opratores are defind ih the algorithm below."

First I traverse the chromosomes in the current generation and check whther the final solution is found or not meanwhile I store the best fitness to save its value in `bestIndividuals` attribute in order to use it in `isInLocalMaxima()` method. Then I start the evolution part. I store the best chromosomes as they transfer directly to next generation without being crossovered and mutated. The number of this chromosomes is based on the hyperparameter `SELECTION_RATE`. The remaining number of chromosomes in next generation are generated by applying cross over and mutation on the chromosomes of current genearion and also the hyperparameters `CROSSOVER_RATE` and `mutationRate` are considered. Note that the population size does not change in each generaion and it is always as size of hyperparameter `POPULATION_SIZE`.\n",

It shows how far we are from the final solution. the furthure we are the higher possibility of the mutation will be.

So if the fitness value of a chromosome is $81 * 3 = 243$ it is the final solution and we have reached the answer, because actually we are considering each gene(sqaue) 3 times. This function is very accurate according to the sudoku rules beacuse we are considering number of different sqauares which pass all 3 conditions of the game rules. Also this function is simple and does not add much time and space complexity."

    "The **crossover** and **mutation** operators are the most important ingredient of GAs. In **crossover**, by selecting individuals from the parental generation and interchanging their genes, new individuals are obtained. Hence, employing a good selection method is vital otherwise it is possible that our algotirhm does not work or not be optimal. In muation function, unlike crossover method, we do not need two parents. Changes are made in genes according to the mutation rate. As the **crossover** function by applying good mutation operators we can generate better offsprings for the next generation therefore our algorith, would be optimal. Although sometimes the mutation operator is discarded and considered as a secondary operator, I used it in this project. Chhosing good combination of mutation and crossover operators can result in improving the performance and completeness of GAs.\n",
    "Mostly the **crossover rate** ($P_c$) is not small beacause of the fact that we are trying to generate offspring from $2$ parents and evolve the generation so I considered the crossover rate as $0.9$. By choosing a small crossover rate $P_c$ each generation would evolve less so we get far from the main purpuse of using GA. Although these hyperparameters are very dependent on the problem. Sometimes the **mutation rate** ($P_m$) are defined as **constant** but sometimes they are calculated **dynamically** throught the algorithm. In this assignment I used **dynamic mutation rate** based on the situation of the chromosoms and as we get closer to the solution the mutation rate decreses. This rate is caldulated by $1 - \\dfrac {fitness} {3 * N * N}$. It shows how far we are from the final solution. Actually the concept of choosing this dynamic mutation rate is like `Simulated Annealing Search`, because as we get closer to the solution the mutation rate decreses and our chromosome would change with less probability. The furthure we are the higher probability of the mutation will be. By applying good mutation rate the diversity of the **pupulation** is kept so $P_m$ can effect on **convergence** of the GA. Usually, large mutation rate would make the GA search to resemble a random search."

So **diversity** is vital in GAs.\n",
